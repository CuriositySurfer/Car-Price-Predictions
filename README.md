# Car Price Predictor Model

In the following data science project, I developed a predictive model to estimate the selling price of cars. The project involved performing exploratory data analysis on the dataset to gain insights into key features affecting car prices. Leveraging the power of machine learning, I applied scikit-learn's regression techniques to build the model.
